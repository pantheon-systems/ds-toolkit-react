## Purpose

Buttons are used to trigger an action — such as closing a modal, submitting a form, or expanding a dropdown menu.

## Usage

Buttons should be easy to find among other elements, including other buttons — different button variants should be used to create hierarchy when more than one button is used.

Button text should be informative and concise.

### Types

#### Primary

The primary type should only have one occurrence per page or logical content block. Avoid having many primary buttons on one page as it will defeat the purpose of this intentionally more prominent button.

#### Critical

The critical type should only be used for destructive actions, such as deletion of data.

#### Tertiary

The tertiary type should only be used when paired with another button, such as for a "cancel" action in a modal. It should never be used independently.

## Buttons vs Links

Buttons and links are distinct elements with distinct purposes — buttons are used to initiate actions, while links are used to navigate to another page, elsewhere on the same page, or to an external destination. Those distinctions are extremely important for assistive technology users. See [Links VS Buttons: A Perennial Problem](https://www.digitala11y.com/links-vs-buttons-a-perennial-problem/) for an in-depth explanation.

Ideally, links should look like links and buttons like buttons, but there may be a rare exception where a link will be styled to look more like a button.
