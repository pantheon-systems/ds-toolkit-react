## Purpose

Buttons are used to trigger an action — such as closing a modal, submitting a form, or expanding a dropdown menu.

## Usage

Buttons should be easy to find among other elements, including other buttons — different button variants should be used to create hierarchy when more than one button is used.

Button text should be informative and concise.

## Buttons vs Links

Buttons and links are distinct elements with distinct purposes — buttons are used to initiate actions, while links are used to navigate to another page, elsewhere on the same page, or to an external destination. Those distinctions are extremely important for assistive technology users. See [Links VS Buttons: A Perennial Problem](https://www.digitala11y.com/links-vs-buttons-a-perennial-problem/) for an in-depth explanation.

Ideally, links should look like links and buttons like buttons, but there may be a rare exception where a link will be styled to look more like a button.
