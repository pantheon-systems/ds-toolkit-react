## Purpose

The Stepper displays progress during a linear process which requires users to complete one step in order to move on to the next. It informs users about which steps have been completed, which step they are currently on, and which steps remain.

Steppers should only be used for processes that contain between 3 to 5 steps.

Users can navigate to previously completed steps by clicking the stepper, but future steps are not able to be selected until the prior step has been completed.
