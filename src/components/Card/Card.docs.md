## Purpose

Cards are minimally-styled containers used to group content into logical sections and designate clear relationships between elements.

## Implementation

The Card component is rendered as a `div` encompassing all `children` passed to the component.

The optional `className` prop will append additional class names after the default `pds-card`.
