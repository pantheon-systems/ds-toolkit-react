## Purpose

The `Checkbox` component is used to present the user with a boolean selection — yes/no, on/off, true/false, for example — but is also used as part of the `CheckboxGroup` component where users can select multiple items from a group of options.

A boolean checkbox is often used in forms where the user must agree to a policy or to opt in to certain functionality.
